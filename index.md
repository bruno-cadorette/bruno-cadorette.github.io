## Advent of code
Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

I did all the challenges in 2015 and half of them in 2016, I plan to complete them one day
Made with Haskell

## Chess with basic distributed AI
We had to make a chess game and use [MPI](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface) to distribute the AI (minmax)
Contains a chess game and the distributed minmax algorithm.
